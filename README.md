# deep-diff

This is a mirror of [deep-diff](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deep-diff), bundled and exposed as ES module.

## Install

```
npm install @bundled-es-modules/deep-diff
bower install bundled-es-modules/deep-diff
```

## Use

```html
<script type="module">
  // from main file
  import { deepDiff } from 'deep-diff';
  // or directly
  import deepDiff from 'deep-diff/deepDiff.js';
  console.log(deepDiff);
</script>
```

Make sure you added `@bundled-es-modules` scope to the path if used via npm.
